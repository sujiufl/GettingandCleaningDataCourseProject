# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project.

This is my submission for the Coursera Course on Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
There are totally three files submitted: 
1. run_analysis.R 
2. CodeBook.md
3. average_tidydata.txt

## The run_analysis.R script does the following:

1. Downloads the data for the project into the working directory.
2. Reads all the relevant data files from the 'test' and 'train' directories.
3. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
5. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
6. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
7. From the data set in step 6, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
